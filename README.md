## Section 24

"React Events" website

### TanStack Query

- useQuery() to find data from the backend
- useMutation(): Sends request to the backend whenever we tell it to, so when we mention mutate we are sending the info to the backend
- isError, error to handle errors which are default props.
- Deleting events, adding events, editing events, and updating events.
  - Optimistic updating: updating instantly. You do this with onMutate() property which is triggered as soon as mutate() is triggered.

## Section 25
